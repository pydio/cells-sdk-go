## Installation

```

## Update SDK

_This is for the maintainers of cells-sdk-go project only._

To update the Cells go sdk, you must folloy the steps below:

_First time only_:

```sh
# go to the roots of this directory, typically:
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go
# Retrieve swagger binary if necessary
## for linux
wget https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/download/0.14.0/swagger_linux_amd64 
## for Mac OS
wget https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/download/0.14.0/swagger_darwin_amd64
```

_After each API Spec modification_:

```sh
# retrieve latest spec file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/cells/master/common/proto/rest/rest.swagger.json
# You might also delete folder models and client 

# simply generate updated code
./swagger generate client --skip-validation -f rest.swagger.json

# Apply the twick to workaround int64 serialisation issue between protobuf and swagger
go run main.go twick-model
```

You should also update version information at the top of this page.

_**NOTE**: we use the --skip-validation flag to avoid circular issues with object that make reference to same type of objects, typically activities and jobs. See [issue #957 in go-swagger repository](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/957) for more details._
