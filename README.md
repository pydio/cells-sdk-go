# Cells API client

Current SDK has been updated on **June. 12th 2019** with git commit **[458779d](https://github.com/pydio/cells/commit/458779d01510f70e5d9223f016b4628444908b98)** for **Cells v1.5.3** release.

The SDK is also valid for **v1.6.0**: the API has not changed with this minor update.

## Overview

This API client was generated by the [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) project.

## How to use

Simply put the package under your project folder and add the following import:

```go
    "github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go"
```

The `transport` sub-package provides some utilitary methods to ease the set up of a communication with your target Cells instance, and you might find the few sample commands that are in the `example` package useful to jump in.

You can also have a look at the [Cells client repository](https://github.com/pydio/cells-client) (also on Github) to see more working examples.
