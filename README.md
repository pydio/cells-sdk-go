# Cells API client

Rest API Client for Pydio Cells.

Temporary note: SDK has been updated on **Apr. 9th 2020** to follow the new development cycle of Cells 2.1+ that is not yet released.

If you are using this in production and until we release Cells 2.1.0, we strongly advise that you stick to previous revision, typically, with go modules:

```go
github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go v0.0.0-20200313145255-e8831efc2d1b
```

Where SDK has been updated on **Mar. 11th 2020** with git commit **[07dc255](https://github.com/pydio/cells/commit/07dc2557e3a7099e8bb3b6c7b0dcb4ac80d31601)** that works **Cells v2.0.5** and previous release.

## Overview

This API client was generated by the [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) project.

## How to use

Simply put the package under your project folder and add the following import:

```go
    "github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go"
```

The `transport` sub-package provides some utilitary methods to ease the set up of a communication with your target Cells instance, and you might find the few sample commands that are in the `example` package useful to jump in.

You can also have a look at the [Cells client repository](https://github.com/pydio/cells-client) (also on Github) to see more working examples.
