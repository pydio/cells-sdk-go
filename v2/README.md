# Cells API client v2

Legacy Rest API Client in go for Pydio Cells. Please see v3 subfolder.

## WARNING LEGACY BRANCH

You should really rather use [the v3 branch](https://github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go/blob/master/v3/README.md)

## Overview

This API client was generated by the [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) project.

For more information, please visit [https://pydio.com](https://pydio.com)

## How to use

Simply put the package under your project folder and add the following import:

```go
    "github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go/v2"
```

The `transport` package provides utilitary methods to ease the set up of a communication with your target Cells instance. You might find the commands that are in the `example` package useful to jump in.

You can also have a look at the [Cells client repository](https://github.com/pydio/cells-client) (also on Github) to see more working examples.

## Versioning policy

As from version 2.2, we will release a minor version of the SDK for each minor version of the Pydio Cells Server.
