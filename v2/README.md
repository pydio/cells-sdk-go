# Cells API client v2

Rest API Client for Pydio Cells v2.

This SDK assumes that your server is running Pydio Cells 2.2.x or later.

## Overview

This API client was generated by the [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) project.

## How to use

Simply put the package under your project folder and add the following import:

```go
    "github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go/v2"
```

The `transport` package provides utilitary methods to ease the set up of a communication with your target Cells instance. You might find the commands that are in the `example` package useful to jump in.

You can also have a look at the [Cells client repository](https://github.com/pydio/cells-client) (also on Github) to see more working examples.

## Versioning policy

As from version 2.2, we will release a minor version of the SDK for each minor version of the Pydio Cells Server.
