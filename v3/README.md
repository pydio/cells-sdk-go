# Cells API client v3

Rest API Client for Pydio Cells v3.

This SDK assumes that your server is running Pydio Cells 3.x or later.

## Overview

This API client was generated by the [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) project.

For more information, please visit [https://pydio.com](https://pydio.com)

## How to use

Simply put the package under your project folder and add the following import:

```go
    "github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go/v3"
```

The `transport` package provides utilitary methods to ease the set up of a communication with your target Cells instance. You might find the commands that are in the `example` package useful to jump in.

You can also have a look at the [Cells client repository](https://github.com/pydio/cells-client) (also on Github) to see more working examples.

## Migrate from version 2

Between version 2 and 3, we have updated the [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) version that we use, to [v0.27.0](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/tag/v0.27.0), this has led to a few breaking changes: you might have to adapt your client code.

Here is a short list of the modification you might have to do:

- `client.PydioCellsRest` is now `client.PydioCellsRestAPI`
- `enum` objects are managed more cleanly:
  - you have to dereference the pointer to make comparison: `*node.Type == models.TreeNodeTypeCOLLECTION`
  - you cannot use a string to create a parameter. This won't compile: `Type: "COLLECTION"` and you must rather write: `Type: models.NewTreeNodeType(models.TreeNodeTypeCOLLECTION)`
- `Acls` param in struc `models.RestCell` has been renamed `ACLs`

## Versioning policy

As from version 2.2, we release a minor version of the SDK for each minor version of the Pydio Cells Server.
